                <p>If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, 
                    You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, 
                    reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, 
                    and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties 
                    (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, 
                    terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii)
                     to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, 
                     unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , 
                     consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., 
                     "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). 
                     The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, 
                     that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, 
                     if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, 
                     then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. 
                     For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution 
                     in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly 
                     assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, 
                     as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, 
                     Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
